					Welcome to Restless Realms.  
					Maybe you're here because a friend told you he played through an hour of his life in the best browser-based MMORPG to date.  
					Maybe the World of Warcraft servers just went down and it's either this or reading a book.  
					Then again, work could be slow and you're just looking for something to do on your lunch hour.  
					No matter what the reason is, we're glad to have you.
					<br/><br/>
					Restless Realms includes a variety of monsters to kill, quests, multiplayer chat and adventures, and other things to keep you away from literature or a guaranteed paycheck and good night of sleep.  
					Oh, and it's free.  
					Not your typical free that comes with distracting banner ads and sneaky suggestions to purchase a t-shirt.  
					Thanks for playing - really, we appreciate your interest in our game and hope you stick around.  
					It only gets better.
					
					<br/><br/>
					Thanks for playing.
